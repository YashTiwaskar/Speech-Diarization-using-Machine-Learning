Speech Diarization
This repository provides a comprehensive pipeline for speech diarization, speaker recognition, and speech transcription using state-of-the-art models such as WhisperX, Silero VAD, and SpeechBrain. It processes audio files, performs voice activity detection, transcribes speech with speaker labels, predicts gender, and exports the diarized results to an Excel file.
